I am thrilled to share that I have successfully developed an app that utilizes Firebase for authentication purposes. The main focus of the app is to cater to electric vehicle users. When a person initiates a request, the app promptly fetches the nearest charging station's location using Google Maps integration. It then measures the distance and estimated time of arrival to the charging station, considering various factors like minimum cost and the quickest route to reach the destination. The app delivers the most optimal results, ensuring users can make informed decisions based on cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. Once the user accepts the suggested charging station and route, they can conveniently view the directions on Google Maps, providing a seamless experience for electric vehicle owners to navigate to the nearest charging station with ease.
